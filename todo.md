# TODO
- [x] Need an About page that would include the about info from the old site. The only update might be to the 7:00 timeframe - we have been meeting closer to the 6:30pm time but this could be left.
- [ ] Need a contact form that will link to the OMBrewers email address
- [ ] Links to a discord for quick and easy conversations  
- [ ] Need a Gallery page to link to our pictures - we should have lots of these. Not sure the best to navigate/display those but being able to view/filter based on date would be great
- [ ] Member page - right now you have a BJCP certified beer judge checkbox and that translates to a label that says Beer judge for public viewing. 
    - [ ] This should be changed display as BJCP certified for public viewing and I have removed that label from Crystal/Paul's listing
    - [ ] Crystal and Paul are not BJCP judges, Crystal has participated as a judge in some comps, but always paired with a certified judge as the head judge of the table (this is a BJCP requirement)
    - [ ] Brian and I are BJCP certified judges and there is a difference in pursuing this certification vs helping with certified judges
- [ ] Meeting minutes page
    - [ ] I think having the current year's meeting minutes listed out on the main page would be great
    - [ ] Then for historical reference/needs, have a link( perhaps at the very bottom) that would say Archived minutes that could link to a google drive where all the minutes would be available
    - [ ] I am sure I can create/pull in dates that may be missing
- [ ] Activities page
    - [ ] I was thinking of keeping only the current year on the main page of our activities - with the past items moving as you have it now - is there an easy way to rest this at the end of the year?
    - [ ] At the bottom, same as the meeting minutes, having a link that would open to a google sheet with the list of all our past activities - this list would be the listing on the education page of our old site
    - [ ] no links to those older resources, but still a list of what has been covered in our activities
